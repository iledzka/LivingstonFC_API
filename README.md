# LivingstonFC_API
RESTful API written in Slim Micro Framework.

This API was implemented based on Building APIs in PHP using the Slim Micro Framerwork course available on lynda.com. 

I have built this API as a part of my Graded Unit project at college. The purpose of it is to provide content for two iOS apps: Livingston FC and Admin Livingston FC.

Livingston FC API has also login and register functinality. It uses JSON Web Token for authorization.
